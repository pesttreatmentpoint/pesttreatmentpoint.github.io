<p>We historically have actually sold nature short, both in its capability to reduce the effects of the efficiency of environmentally unsound methods as well as its selection of intrinsic strengths that can be utilized to keep pest organisms within bounds. For example, stress of predaceous mites, rove beetles, lacewings, and types of parasitoids have been chosen for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, consequently increasing the likelihood that some will endure insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>

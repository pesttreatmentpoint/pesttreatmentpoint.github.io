<p>In reference to the principle of incorporating making use of other and biological controls in complementary methods, the term was later on expanded to accept collaborated use of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural opponents are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have actually been chosen either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to possess greater levels of resistance.</p>
<p>Biological control has been successfully used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To resolve intrusive pest problems, classical biological control technique is normally used where natural enemies from the native region of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control technique that has actually been successfully used against a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>

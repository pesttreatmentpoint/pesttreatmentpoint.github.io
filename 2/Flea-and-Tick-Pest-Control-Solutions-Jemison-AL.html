<p>Pesticides are picked and applied in a way that reduces their possible harm to individuals, nontarget organisms, and the environment. IPM is probably to be misunderstood as pest management without chemicals which in reality requirement based use of chemicals. Pests can be brought into the food processing center through the supply chain, in the ingredients or packaging, and the center itself will draw in pests through food odours and lighting.</p>
<p>On the other hand, organic food production uses many of the same principles as IPM but limits making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, instead of synthetic chemicals. Other claims consist of decreases in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to decrease the need for other, less environmentally favorable, herbicides.</p>

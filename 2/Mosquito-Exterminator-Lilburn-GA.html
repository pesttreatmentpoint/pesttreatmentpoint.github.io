<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control household bug pests. Numerous anti-pesticide NGOs have a a lot more simplified definition of IPM - they see IPM as being almost solely about minimizing pesticide usage. If all other integrated pest management techniques are unable to keep an insect pest population listed below a financial threshold, then use of an insecticide to control the pest and avoid financial loss is justified.</p>
<p>Consider alternative methods (besides pesticides) to make your home and garden unattractive to pests. With IPM, you act to keep pests from ending up being an issue, such as by growing a healthy crop that can hold up against pest attacks, using disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from going into a structure. Current quests for reliable, safe, and long lasting pest management programs have been targeted mainly toward development of brand-new and better products with which to change conventional harmful pesticides.</p>

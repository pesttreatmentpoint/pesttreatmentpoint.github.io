<p>Simultaneously, it is also based on semiochemicals particularly allomones and kairomones 35 The pests are warded off or deterred far from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are at the same time drawn in (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be eliminated or eliminated 35 (Figure 5 ).

Other claims consist of reductions in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into numerous crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to lower the requirement for other, less ecologically favorable, herbicides.</p>

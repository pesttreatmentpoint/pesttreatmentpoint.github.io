It is a term that refers to the way in which growers cultivate and secure their crops based upon an understanding of cycles in and around plants, of balances and relationships of reliance in between plants, micro-organisms, nutrients and insects.</p>
<p>The determination of the proper cause of pest issue (understanding pest biology) and ecology is vital in controling the environment to the crop's benefit and to the hinderance of the pest.

<h3>Pest Control Is an Important Part of Our Daily Life East Chicago IN</h3>
<p>Although numerous sources define IPM in various methods, previous designs mainly focused on the ecological, and to some extent on the evolutionary, aspects of pest management (Peterson et al. 2018 ). A current IPM pyramid presented by Stenberg (2017) determined a lack of a holistic IPM approach that utilizes both conventional and modern-day tools.</p>
<p>In IPM, pesticides are utilized only when required and in combination with other approaches for more effective, long-lasting control. The advantages of GM crops extend beyond the decrease in insecticides, because they are compatible with other pest management strategies, specifically biological control.

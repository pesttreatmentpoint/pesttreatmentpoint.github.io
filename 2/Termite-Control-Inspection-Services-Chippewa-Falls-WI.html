Pesticides not consisted of in baits or traps must generally just be used to targeted areas, not sprayed over the whole room. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a viewpoint that includes the management of a pest rather of managing or getting rid of a pest. TAP insulation for attics, wetness barriers for crawl areas, and specifically crafted weather stripping for garage and entry doors not just discourage rodents and other destructive pests from getting in and living in your home, they're energy efficient, too.</p>
<p>In IPM, pesticides are used just when needed and in combination with other techniques for more reliable, long-term control. The advantages of GM crops extend beyond the decrease in insecticides, due to the fact that they work with other pest management methods, specifically biological control.

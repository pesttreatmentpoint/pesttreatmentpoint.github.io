<p>You only need to spend an hour on the web to be overwhelmed by international problems: the vicious cycle that emerges from the use of big amounts of artificial fertilizer, which increases reliance on pesticides, which in turn causes resistance and damage of the environment and human health - while in fifty years' time the world's stocks of the most essential component of synthetic fertilizer, phosphate, will almost have gone out.</p>
<p>If pesticides are essential, they are selected and applied in such a way that prevents interfering with other IPM practices. Nearly every kind of pest poses a danger to the residential or commercial properties they live in, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards. Beyond Pesticides supports the implementation of an Ecological Pest Management (EPM) or strongly specified Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program in the indoor environment, and Organic Land Care (OLC) practices in the outside environment.</p>
<p>For instance, if you're not exactly sure whether you have carpenter ants or termites, get help determining the pest from your local extension service or exterminator. General pest control provides you total protection from the pests that currently inhabit your home in addition to from the pests that might attack in the future. To that end, every exterminator on our website has been screened by us to ensure they are certified and licensed to provide the essential pest control solutions for clients.</p>

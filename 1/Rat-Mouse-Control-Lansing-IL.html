Crops are frequently monocultures, including a single crop types, which creates a homogenous environment often lacking key requirements of natural enemies, thus favoring pest types.</p>
<p>This may include the use of several pesticides with different modes of action. Trap crops are planted to attract and hold pest insects where they can be managed more effectively and prevent or reduce their movement onto important crops. Schedules are used to categorize pesticides and to control the availability of a product to the general public. Termites need moisture for their survival, for this reason moist walls, leakage and water seepage resemble open invites for them.</p>

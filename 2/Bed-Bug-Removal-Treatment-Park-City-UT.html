<p>Socio-psychological factors consisting of ethical and rational considerations were found to the drivers in IPM implementation in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A survey of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka showed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or disease incident and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A survey conducted by Parsa et al. (2014) likewise revealed that an absence of qualified IPM professionals and extension educators was an impediment for IPM execution in industrialized countries.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural enemies and dissuade pest persistence consist of intercropping (numerous crops in the exact same field) to make it harder for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which draw in pests far from harvest crops and which can later on be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to coincide with times where pests have emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
<p>When a helpful microbe remains in a symbiotic relationship with a plant, it will actively protect the plant by deterring pests and damaging harmful germs and fungis. We understand how scary it can be to have even the tiniest sign of a bed bug invasion These pests can cause skin inflammation and disrupt your life, and what's worse is they spread out rapidly and are hard to eliminate. Don't combat a bed bug battle on your own.</p>
<p>Integrated pest management implies mindful consideration of all available plant protection approaches and subsequent combination of appropriate steps that dissuade the development of populations of harmful organisms and keep the use of plant protection items and other kinds of intervention to levels that are financially and ecologically justified and reduce or minimise dangers to human health and the environment.</p>

Lots of anti-pesticide NGOs have a a lot more simplistic meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being practically solely about lowering pesticide usage. If all other integrated pest management methods are not able to keep an insect pest population below an economic threshold, then use of an insecticide to control the pest and avoid financial loss is warranted.</p>

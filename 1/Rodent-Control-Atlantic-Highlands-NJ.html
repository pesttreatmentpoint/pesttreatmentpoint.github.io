<p>In Asia, different stages of IPM have been successfully embraced in Bangladesh (rice), China (cotton, fruit crops, maize, rice, soybean, veggies), USA (cotton, fruit crops, sugarcane, vegetables), Indonesia (rice), Korea (rice), Malaysia (vegetables, plantation crops), Pakistan (cotton, mango, sugarcane), Philippine (rice), Tadjikistan (cotton), Thailand (cotton), Turkmenistan (cotton), Vietnam (rice) (Tables 6 and 8, Ooi et al. 1991, Raheja 1995, Morse & Buhler 1997).</p>
<p>In addition to developing clear indicators that a pest control program is certainly an IPM system, it is also required to provide criteria to determine performance of the system. Usually between 30 minutes to 2 hours is required to carry out the general pest control treatment. Public need is affected by retail marketing techniques, issues for food security based upon pesticide guidelines in their area, and an absence of understanding on food production among other elements.</p>
<p>Biological control methods can likewise be viewed as natural options as they do not depend on using pesticides or other chemicals. Pest control is essential because rodents and insects carry diseases, infest your cooking areas and bed rooms, and bite you or your family pets. Use indicator plants to determine the effectiveness of pest management tactics and to monitor vulnerable crops for the viruses (tospoviruses) such as impatiens necrotic area infection (INSV) and tomato spotted wilt infection (TSWV).</p>
<p>It is likewise obvious from many discussions with growers and pest control experts in California that resistance management viewed as turning pesticides amongst various mode of action groups is frequently viewed as IPM, although resistance management is only a part of IPM.

<p>There is no clear clinical proof that taking in crop products originated from genetically crafted plants has triggered harmful impacts to humans or animals (e.g., 75% of all cheeses consist of chymosin, which is, and has been for some time, produced with genetically engineered germs). In many developing countries, where IPM is now governmental policy, pesticide use is being reduced.</p>

Crop losses due to diseases, arthropods, and weeds, though contested by some as a legitimate procedure, have actually increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) in spite of the accumulation of pest control.</p>
<p>IPM techniques consist of both chemical and nonchemical means to prevent and control pest populations from reaching economically harmful levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the smallest effective dosage when other techniques of pest control have failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that concentrates on long-lasting avoidance of pests or their damage through a mix of methods such as biological control, habitat control, adjustment of cultural practices, and use of resistant ranges.</p>

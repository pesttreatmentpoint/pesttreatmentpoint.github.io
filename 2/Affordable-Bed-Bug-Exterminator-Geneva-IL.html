<p>Before signing a contract for pest control, you must be clear about the rate being paid, the services being covered and the existence of cancellation fees, Anti-Pesto states. You can use traps to catch specific pests, and barriers to protect plants from insect attack or disease infection. Along the continuum, extra non-chemical methods such as cultural controls, biological controls, resistant crop varieties, mating disruption, sterile bug release, and so on, may be integrated into the system.</p>

<p>This combination of IGRs can be efficient in avoiding re-infestation of pests such as cockroaches. SWPM is vulnerable to attack by wood boring insects which, in a collection environment, might trigger severe damage to structures, office furniture, specimens and artifacts. Applicators perform more complex tasks, are able to use a wider variety of pesticides, and may focus on a certain location of pest control.</p>
<p>Knowledgeable field crews will have the ability to recognize and keep an eye on pest issues and efficiently execute the management techniques. The concept of integrated pest management (IPM) came from almost 60 years back in reaction to these unfavorable effects of pesticides. Numerous of the resources noted at the end of this leaflet can be used for recognition of insect pests affecting collections.</p>
<p>The many differing risks from pests make it suggested for cultural heritage companies to develop an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their collections and buildings. In these nations, regular use of pesticides is restricted to high worth (money) crops and, as such, IPM adoption is largely fixated cotton, soybean, rice, and sugarcane.</p>
<p>Think about alternative approaches (other than pesticides) to make your house and garden unappealing to pests. With IPM, you do something about it to keep pests from becoming an issue, such as by growing a healthy crop that can endure pest attacks, using disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from going into a structure. Recent missions for efficient, safe, and long lasting pest management programs have been targeted mainly towards development of brand-new and much better products with which to replace standard poisonous pesticides.</p>

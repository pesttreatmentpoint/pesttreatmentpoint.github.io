For that reason, a simple switch to nontoxic pesticides, such as microbials or inundative releases of natural opponents, although useful in lowering environmental contamination and safety problems, still does not truly attend to the ecologically based weakness of the conventional pest control method.</p>
<p>We traditionally have sold nature short, both in its capability to neutralize the efficiency of ecologically unsound approaches in addition to its range of fundamental strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds. For example, stress of predaceous mites, rove beetles, lacewings, and species of parasitoids have been chosen for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, therefore increasing the probability that some will endure insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>

IPM worries using non-chemical control methods, such as exemption or trapping, prior to chemical options.</p>
<p>Keeping an eye on ways inspecting your field, forest, landscape, or structure-- or other site-- to recognize which pests exist, how many there are, or what damage they have actually triggered.

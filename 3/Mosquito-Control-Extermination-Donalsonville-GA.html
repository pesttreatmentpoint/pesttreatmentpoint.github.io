<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical techniques such as cultural practices, usage of resistant varieties, appropriate watering and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM considers the environment as a whole and thinks about a well balanced mix of the aforementioned control techniques to produce the most effective and least harmful plan.</p>
<p>These crops share a number of the same pests and natural opponent fauna. This indicates that as quickly as you see any mice, rats, bed bugs or any other pests, you should act right away in order to prevent them to continue replicating and end up being a greater issue. Our pest control company is so much more than an exterminating service company, we're your Family, Pals, & Neighbors.</p>

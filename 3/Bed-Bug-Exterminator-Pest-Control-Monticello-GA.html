<p>Destruction of crop residue: Pupae of bug stays inside the crop residue and can be controlled by destroying it. IPM is practiced to some degree in all agricultural crops, but artificial pesticides stay a dominant technique in handling pests. Perhaps you're the type to dive in, research study your pest, check out the most effective control alternatives, and are feeling well prepared to take things on on your own.</p>
<p>In reference to the idea of integrating making use of biological and other controls in complementary ways, the term was later broadened to welcome coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have been picked either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to possess greater levels of resistance.</p>

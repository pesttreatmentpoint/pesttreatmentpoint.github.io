<p>Natural enemies such as parasitic wasps and predatory arthropods can be very efficient in triggering considerable decreases in pest populations in particular circumstances (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ).

<p>If, after following preventive and organized management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above threshold levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or use selected biopesticides with low ecological effect. Expert exterminators use various kinds of pesticides and baits to kill and get rid of pests. Efficient, long-term corrective actions can then be taken to avoid pests from entering the structure and infesting the structure and collections.</p>

Along the continuum, extra non-chemical techniques such as cultural controls, biological controls, resistant crop ranges, mating disruption, sterile insect release, and so on, might be integrated into the system.</p>
<p>Releases of natural enemies may be required throughout the growing season in order to sustain arthropod pests at low populations.

<h3>The Advantages of Hiring a Pest Control Service Lebanon OH</h3>
<p>Although multiple sources define IPM in various ways, previous designs primarily focused on the environmental, and to some extent on the evolutionary, aspects of pest management (Peterson et al. 2018 ). A recent IPM pyramid provided by Stenberg (2017) identified an absence of a holistic IPM method that utilizes both modern and standard tools.</p>
<p>When kept for a long time, saved product pests are most likely to be in a food component on delivery to a processing factory or a processed food product. Using pesticides to crops, animals, buildings or landscapes on a routine basis, regardless of requirement, is not IPM. The reliance on pesticides as a sole method of control has actually led to the advancement of insect resistance and negative impacts on human health, natural opponents, and the environment.</p>

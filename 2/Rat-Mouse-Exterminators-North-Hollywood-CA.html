<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and a few of the pesticides used in a natural system are as harmful to people and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides. Pest control experts can only do so much to secure the food supply," states Dr. Zia Siddiqi, Director of Quality Systems at Orkin The reality is, food business operators have to take an active role in integrated pest management by working closely with the experts.</p>
<p>These unidentified or badly comprehended prospective dangers argue for extra levels of defense including direct exposures to several pesticides, in the house, at school and in the diet plan; direct exposure to chemicals in mix with pesticides such as pharmaceuticals, commercial compounds and individual care items; and the basic trouble in attributing persistent illnesses to any one particular cause.</p>
<p>IPCA strongly suggests hiring proficient and certified pest control professionals from IPCA Member organisations across the country. Farming deals with the problem with incorporated pest management. The term pest" describes more than one cause of issues consisting of diseases, unwanted insects, mites, weeds, nematodes and mollusks. A number of treatment approaches have been used, including chemical techniques, such as pesticide applications and toxic gas fumigations; and non-chemical treatments, such as freezing or heating the products, the use of micro-waves, gamma radiation, customized atmospheres, and anoxic fumigation.</p>

Requirements of infested locations and distinguished application of plant protection products minimize the damage for human beings and nature as chemicals are used just when it is really necessary.</p>

<h3>How to Save on Commercial Pest Control Services Fletcher NC</h3>
<p>Biological pest control steps make the most of the hierarchy within nature. IPM programmes preliminary task is to develop acceptable pest levels, called action limits, and apply controls where the thresholds are crossed. Knowledge of these limits and dynamics of pests and natural opponents helps to avoid unnecessary (chemical) interventions. Some termite control specialists even fix structural damage triggered by termites.</p>

The advantages of GM crops extend beyond the decrease in insecticides, because they are compatible with other pest management methods, specifically biological control.

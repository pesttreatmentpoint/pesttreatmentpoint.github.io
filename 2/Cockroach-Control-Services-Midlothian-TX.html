<p>Biological control has been successfully utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To attend to invasive pest concerns, classical biological control method is generally utilized where natural enemies from the native region of the intrusive pest are imported, increased, and released in the brand-new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ).

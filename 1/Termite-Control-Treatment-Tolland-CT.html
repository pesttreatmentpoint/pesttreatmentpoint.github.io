IPM is the choice and use of pest control actions that will guarantee beneficial economic condition, social and eco-friendly consequences 13 and applies to most farming, public health and amenity pest management circumstances.</p>
<p>Our Integrated Pest Management (IPM) technique is based upon our four principles that together we call ERDM. We comprehend that discovering pests in your home or business is distressing. Flexibility and Time- The process of pest control requires time and efforts. Pests are undesirable plants, animals, insects, bacteria or other organisms that interfere with human activity.</p>

Pest control offer treatment for termites services include pre-post building termite control. Pesticides with a lower EIQ Field Use Rating have a lower environmental impact.</p>

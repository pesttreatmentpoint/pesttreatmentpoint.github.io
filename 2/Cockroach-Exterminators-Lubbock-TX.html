<p>Dorchester County runs a Mosquito Control Program to protect its residents from the spread of mosquito-borne illness by spraying pesticides (insecticides), using larvicide to low-lying locations, and informing its residents on reducing the conditions that promote increases in the mosquito population. The objective is to optimize pest death while reducing harm to natural enemies.

<p>Pest management needs a holistic method to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are applied just after regular tracking shows that a pest population had actually reached an economic limit level. Numerous specific commodity growers, for such crop as potatoes and strawberries, are working to define what IPM indicates for their crop and region, and IPM-labeled foods are readily available in minimal areas.</p>

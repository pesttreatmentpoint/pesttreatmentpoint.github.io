<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, usage of resistant varieties, appropriate irrigation and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM considers the environment as a whole and takes into consideration a balanced mix of the abovementioned control methods to produce the most reliable and least harmful strategy.</p>
<p>Monitoring and identification minimizes the dangers of utilizing the wrong kind of pesticide, or using pesticides when other techniques will be more reliable. The advantage of the misting pest control technique is that it's considered to be eco-friendly, it's odor-free and does not leave any residues that are hard to be cleaned. Cultural practices - depend on a technique to make the crop or habitat undesirable to pests by interfering with their oviposition preferences, host plant discrimination or location by both grownups and immatures.</p>
<p>Automatic workload updates, gadget summaries and customer websites are very important tools that industrial pest control companies must have access to within their field service software of option in order to succeed.

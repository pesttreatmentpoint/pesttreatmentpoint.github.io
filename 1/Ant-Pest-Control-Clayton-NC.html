<p>Their professional exterminators are readily available for 24 hr of emergency situation services for their important customers. However, the high capacity for reproduction of insect pests stays, and a population surge of numerous types can be expected from a low-density level whenever appropriate ecological conditions occur or control slackens. Under this plan, bug control was "supervised" by certified entomologists, and insecticide applications were based on conclusions reached from regular monitoring of pest and natural-enemy populations.</p>
<p>Mechanical controls-- Should a pest reach an inappropriate level, mechanical techniques are the very first choices. Save 10% on preliminary pest control services.

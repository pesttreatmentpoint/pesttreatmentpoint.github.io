<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control home pest pests. Numerous anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simplistic definition of IPM - they see IPM as being almost specifically about reducing pesticide usage.

<p>An extensive understanding of basic IPM concepts and different management options for all possible pest problems is essential as some are preventive and others are alleviative. We typically suggest pest control chemicals that finish the job using the least amount of item. Broad spectrum pesticides (as a last hope). These prevention and control methods include biological, mechanical, cultural, physical, genetic, chemical, and regulative techniques.</p>

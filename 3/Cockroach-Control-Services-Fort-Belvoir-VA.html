<p>The lots of differing hazards from pests make it a good idea for cultural heritage companies to establish an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their structures and collections. In these countries, regular use of pesticides is restricted to high value (money) crops and, as such, IPM adoption is mostly centered on cotton, rice, sugarcane, and soybean.</p>
<p>If, after following scheduled and preventive management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above threshold levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or use selected biopesticides with low environmental effect. Professional exterminators utilize different types of baits and pesticides to kill and eliminate pests. Reliable, permanent corrective actions can then be required to prevent pests from going into the structure and infesting the structure and collections.</p>

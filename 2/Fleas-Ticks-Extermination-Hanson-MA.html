<p>Tighter guidelines for food security, occupational health and safety, and the environment suggest internal pest control isn't an option for many food organisations these days. Farmers are confronted with myriad of production difficulties where the most common issues are pests, which include weeds, insects, and illness. Similarly, pest and crop management disciplines need to collaborate to develop control suggestions that show these interactions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, natural food production uses a number of the same concepts as IPM but limits the use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, instead of synthetic chemicals. Other claims include decreases in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to lower the need for other, less ecologically beneficial, herbicides.</p>

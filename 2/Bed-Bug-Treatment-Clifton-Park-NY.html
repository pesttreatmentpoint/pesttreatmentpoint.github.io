<p>Action Pest Control supplies comprehensive bed bug control services consisting of examinations carried out by highly trained bed bug dogs and bed bug heat treatments administered by expert bed bug experts. With more regulations on pesticide use and a reduction in the variety of active ingredients in some crops, there is a greater emphasis on much better understanding of available control options (Hillocks 2012 ).

<p>4 ). With its success in lots of parts of the world, IPM is considered as a environmentally benign and cost-effective  pest control technique preferably suited for both little and big farmers worldwide. When termites have gotten in a structure, they do not restrict themselves to wood; they also damage paper, cloth, carpets and more.

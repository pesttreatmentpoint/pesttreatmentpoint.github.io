<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical techniques such as cultural practices, use of resistant ranges, correct watering and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM thinks about the community as an entire and takes into account a well balanced mix of the aforementioned control techniques to produce the most reliable and least damaging plan.</p>
<p>Some also acknowledged that if regionally coordinated IPM could take place, even annual management of a consistent pest could be made more effective (Faust and Chandler, 1998). We recruit exterminators who focus on commercial or commercial pest control. Continuous training and education of farmers represent the foundation for establishment of strong and efficient IPM program in agroecosystems.</p>
<p>A glue-board program will typically provide an efficient ways of control. Since ecological conditions, the severity of pest pressure, and techniques of application vary widely, recommendations do not suggest that efficiency of pesticides will always be appropriate.

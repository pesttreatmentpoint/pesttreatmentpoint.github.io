<p>Biological control has been successfully used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To deal with intrusive pest problems, classical biological control approach is normally utilized where natural enemies from the native area of the intrusive pest are imported, increased, and released in the new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ).

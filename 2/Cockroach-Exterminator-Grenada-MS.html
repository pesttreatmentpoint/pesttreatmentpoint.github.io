<p>More information is required about food-chain concentration and practical methods of getting rid of damaging effects of pesticide residues that might stay in the environment after the pesticides have served their function. Don't base pest management programs on total removal of a pest. Pests assault plants from everywhere: rodents and nematode spoil roots in the earth, snails, and larvae damage berries and leaves originating from the ground, and birds consume fruit and seeds assaulting from the air.</p>
<p>Community IPM specialists work to identify and fix pest-friendly conditions, getting rid of access to food, water and harborage by enhancing sanitation, maintenance, exclusion and landscape management practices. When it declined to hunt the target types and ended up being a pest itself, the walking cane toad is another case illustrating biological control failure in this regard.</p>

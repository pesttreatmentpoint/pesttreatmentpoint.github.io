<h2>How To Pick a Local Pest Exterminator Company in Newtown</h2>
<p><img src="https://pestimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/pest-treatment.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Termites are nasty customers. For some jobs, pest control employees use a combination of pest management strategies, a practice called integrated pest management. The foundation of an efficient IPM program is a schedule of routine assessments. Crop losses due to illness, weeds, and arthropods, though contested by some as a legitimate step, have actually increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) in spite of the surge of pest control.</p>
<p>Current research studies document the need for ongoing reductions in hazardous pesticide use and practices. Although the basic elements of IPM are always the exact same, the specific elements of an IPM program differ from one environment or situation to another. When done before spacing the plants, application of predatory termites versus thrips in potted plants is more reliable.</p>

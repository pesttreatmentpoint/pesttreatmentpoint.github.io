<p>Experienced field teams will have the ability to identify and keep track of pest problems and successfully perform the management methods. The idea of incorporated pest management (IPM) stemmed practically 60 years earlier in reaction to these unfavorable effects of pesticides. Numerous of the resources noted at the end of this brochure can be used for recognition of insect pests impacting collections.</p>
<p>Natural enemies such as predatory arthropods and parasitic wasps can be extremely reliable in causing considerable decreases in pest populations in certain scenarios (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ). Periodical releases of commercially offered natural opponents or saving natural opponent populations by providing refuges or avoiding practices that hurt them are some of the typical practices to control endemic pests.</p>
<p>In contrast, natural food production uses many of the very same principles as IPM but restricts using pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than synthetic chemicals. Other claims include decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to minimize the requirement for other, less ecologically beneficial, herbicides.</p>

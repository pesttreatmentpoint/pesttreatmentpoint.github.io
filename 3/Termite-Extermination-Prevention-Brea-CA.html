<p>You just need to invest an hour on the web to be overwhelmed by international issues: the vicious cycle that arises from using large quantities of synthetic fertilizer, which increases reliance on pesticides, which in turn causes resistance and damage of the environment and human health - while in fifty years' time the world's stocks of the most important part of synthetic fertilizer, phosphate, will virtually have run out.</p>
<p>Chemical pesticides are categorized into different groups based upon their mode of action (IRAC 2018) and rotating chemicals from different mode of action groups is recommended to reduce the risk of resistance advancement (Sparks and Nauen 2015 ). Federal government guidelines restrict the time and amount of specific chemical pesticides and help alleviate the involved risks.</p>

<p>Although multiple sources specify IPM in different methods, previous models mainly focused on the eco-friendly, and to some extent on the evolutionary, aspects of pest management (Peterson et al. 2018 ).

<p>This might consist of using several pesticides with different modes of action. Trap crops are planted to hold and attract pest insects where they can be managed more effectively and avoid or decrease their motion onto important crops. Schedules are utilized to categorize pesticides and to control the schedule of an item to the general public. Termites need wetness for their survival, for this reason damp walls, leakage and water seepage resemble open invitations for them.</p>

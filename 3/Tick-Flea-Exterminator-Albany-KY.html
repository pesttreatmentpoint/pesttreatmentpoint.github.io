<p>Socio-psychological aspects consisting of moral and logical factors to consider were found to the drivers in IPM application in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of veggie growers in Sri Lanka revealed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or disease occurrence and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ).

<p>IPM is utilized in farming, cultivation, forestry, human habitations, preventive preservation and general pest control, including structural pest management, grass pest management and decorative pest management. Deal with a pest problem with a hand sprayer, fertilize your yard with a granular spreader, deal with termite treatments with a foamer, bait for roaches and ants with a professional bait weapon, or use pre-emergent herbicides with a knapsack sprayer.</p>

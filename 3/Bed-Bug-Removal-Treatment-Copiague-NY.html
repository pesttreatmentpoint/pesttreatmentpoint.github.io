<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, use of resistant ranges, appropriate watering and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM considers the community as an entire and thinks about a well balanced mix of the previously mentioned control approaches to produce the most efficient and least harmful strategy.</p>
<p>Todays specialists use Integrated Pest Management techniques that include traps and exclusion techniques to control pests. 2Standard Covered Pests consist of cockroaches, mice, rats, silverfish, "home" ants (leaving out carpenter ants, fire ants, pharaoh ants & tawny crazy ants), clothing moths, non-poisonous spiders, scorpions, centipedes, millipedes, earwigs, home crickets and paper wasps.</p>
<p>Biological control has actually been successfully utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To address intrusive pest concerns, classical biological control approach is generally used where natural opponents from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and released in the new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control strategy that has actually been successfully utilized versus a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>Other approaches include hand picking of pests, sticky boards or tapes for control of flying insects in greenhouses and different trapping strategies. IPM takes advantage of all appropriate pest management options consisting of, but not limited to, the cautious use of pesticides.

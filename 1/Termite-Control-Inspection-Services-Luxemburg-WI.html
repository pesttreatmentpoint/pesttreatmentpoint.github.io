<p>There are lots of agricultural practices that make the environment less beneficial to insect pests. IPM extended the principle of incorporated control to all classes of pests and was broadened to include all methods. This chapter goes over different methods to preserve pest insects at tolerable levels or to put it simply incorporated pest management (IPM). Keep pets and kids away from areas where pesticides have actually been applied.</p>
<p>Some of these are: neem spray, prepared from neem kernels (Azadirachta indica) extract, effective versus sucking pests, jassids, bollworms and thrips; pyrethrum, prepared from powdered flower heads or liquid extracts of chrysanthemum, reliable against red cotton bug, cutworms, insects; botanical mixes, combinations of extracts from various plants such as castor, thorn apple, lantana, custard apple, sweet potato leaves, tomato leaves, ginger, cold, gliricidia, marigold, and so on</p>

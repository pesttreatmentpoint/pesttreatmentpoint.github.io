Pests seek out places with an abundant food source, as well as a safe environment in which they can reproduce. Other fairly low-risk pesticides are offered for some pests.

<p>You only need to spend an hour on the internet to be overwhelmed by worldwide concerns: the vicious cycle that emerges from making use of large quantities of synthetic fertilizer, which increases reliance on pesticides, which in turn causes resistance and damage of the environment and human health - while in fifty years' time the world's stocks of the most important part of artificial fertilizer, phosphate, will virtually have actually run out.</p>

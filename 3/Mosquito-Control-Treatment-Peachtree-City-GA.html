The term pest" describes more than one cause of issues consisting of diseases, unwanted insects, mites, weeds, nematodes and mollusks. A number of treatment methods have been utilized, consisting of chemical methods, such as pesticide applications and hazardous gas fumigations; and non-chemical treatments, such as freezing or heating up the products, using micro-waves, gamma radiation, customized atmospheres, and anoxic fumigation.</p>
<p>Chemical pesticides are categorized into different groups based on their mode of action (IRAC 2018) and turning chemicals from different mode of action groups is suggested to minimize the risk of resistance development (Stimulates and Nauen 2015 ). Federal government regulations limit the time and amount of certain chemical pesticides and help reduce the associated threats.</p>

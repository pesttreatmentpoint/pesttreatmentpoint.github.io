<p>Termites are nasty customers. For some jobs, pest control employees utilize a mix of pest management strategies, a practice called integrated pest management. The foundation of a reliable IPM program is a schedule of regular evaluations. Crop losses due to illness, arthropods, and weeds, though disputed by some as a valid measure, have actually increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) in spite of the surge of pest control.</p>
<p>When pest problems are prevented, pests are not present to do damage, so no control steps are required. Arthropod resistance to abamectin (Stumpf and Nauen 2002 ), B. thuringiensis solutions or its cry contaminants in genetically customized crops (Hama et al. 1992, Tabashnik et al. 2013 ), spinosad (Scott 2008 ), and other biopesticides (Dara 2017) are well recorded.</p>

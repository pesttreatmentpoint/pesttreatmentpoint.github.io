<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, use of resistant ranges, appropriate watering and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM thinks about the environment as a whole and takes into account a well balanced mix of the previously mentioned control methods to produce the most efficient and least harmful strategy.</p>

To control certain pests, multiple applications of natural pesticides may be necessary with associated costs and dangers, while similar pest populations might be controlled by fewer chemical pesticide applications.</p>

<p>Only then can we decrease making use of artificial fertilizers, decrease reliance on pesticides and increase performance. Here, insecticides will only be used when they are economically feasible and it appears that natural enemies will not control the pests. Crop rotation: Monocultures supply prospective cotton pests with abundant food sources, causing their populations to increase quickly.</p>
<p>IPM approaches include both chemical and nonchemical methods to avoid and control pest populations from reaching economically destructive levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the tiniest reliable dosage when other approaches of pest control have stopped working. IPM is an ecosystem-based technique that focuses on long-term prevention of pests or their damage through a combination of methods such as biological control, environment manipulation, modification of cultural practices, and usage of resistant varieties.</p>
<p>Issues with pesticide-intensive pest control programs (see above) are the driving force behind IPM adoption or at least consideration for its adoption at the nationwide or local level in many nations, and in many it has actually ended up being main governmental policy. The use of chemical agents to handle either regular pest mitigation or more established invasions need to be left to expert pest management companies who are trained and certified in accordance with state guidelines and health and safety requirements.</p>

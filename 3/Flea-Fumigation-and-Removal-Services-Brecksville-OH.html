<p>Although botanical extracts such as azadirachtin and pyrethrins, and microbe-derived hazardous metabolites such as avermectin and spinosad are considered biologicals (Lasota and Dybas 1991, Sarfraz et al. 2005, Dodia et al. 2010 ), they are still chemical particles, comparable to artificial chemicals, and possess much of the ecological and human safety risks as chemical pesticides.</p>

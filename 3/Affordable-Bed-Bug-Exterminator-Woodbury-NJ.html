<p>Tighter guidelines for food security, occupational health and safety, and the environment suggest in-house pest control isn't an option for lots of food companies these days.

<p>On the other hand, natural food production uses many of the very same principles as IPM however restricts making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than synthetic chemicals. Other claims include reductions in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to minimize the requirement for other, less ecologically favorable, herbicides.</p>

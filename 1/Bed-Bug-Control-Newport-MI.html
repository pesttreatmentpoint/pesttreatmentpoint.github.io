<p>In the pest control stories, the children discovered that farmers utilize ladybirds to eliminate aphids on their crops, and that a big weed-eating underwater mammal (the manatee) is utilized by river authorities to keep waterways clear for boats. When it is really necessary, requirements of plagued areas and differentiated application of plant security products minimize the damage for human beings and nature as chemicals are utilized only.</p>

<h3>The Truth About Termites and Pest Control Benton Harbor MI</h3>
<p>Although several sources define IPM in different ways, previous models mainly concentrated on the eco-friendly, and to some degree on the evolutionary, elements of pest management (Peterson et al. 2018 ). A current IPM pyramid provided by Stenberg (2017) determined a lack of a holistic IPM method that utilizes both standard and modern tools.</p>

Property owners can execute their own IPM programs or demand that their provider utilize IPM when performing pest management within their home or landscape. Categories might include basic pest control, rodent control, termite control, fumigation, and turf and ornamental control.</p>

<p>Tighter guidelines for food security, occupational health and safety, and the environment suggest in-house pest control isn't an option for lots of food companies these days.

Other claims include reductions in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to minimize the requirement for other, less ecologically favorable, herbicides.</p>

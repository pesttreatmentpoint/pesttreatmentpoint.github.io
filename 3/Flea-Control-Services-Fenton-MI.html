<p>Pest, weed, and disease issues are minimized through natural control by the enriched natural enemy fauna, making use of weed-competitive or illness- and pest-resistant varieties (with a focus on long lasting systems for resistance), decrease of nitrogen fertilization, and judicious usage of chemical pest control based upon careful population tasting and decision thresholds.</p>
<p>The determination of the proper cause of pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is necessary in manipulating the environment to the crop's benefit and to the hinderance of the pest. Insecticides hazardous to the majority of insects (broad-spectrum) will more negatively impact natural opponents than materials that are selective or narrow-spectrum for particular insect types or life phases.</p>
<p>Many newer pesticides are originated from plants or naturally occurring substances (e.g.-- pyrethrum, nicotine and bug juvenile hormonal agent analogues), however the toxophore or active part might be altered to supply increased biological activity or stability. If we cultivate crops according to the idea of Integrated Pest Management (IPM), a lot of researchers concur that this will be possible just.</p>

The most effective, long-lasting way to manage pests is by utilizing a mix of methods that work better together than individually. In monitored control, (incorporated control) the best mix of chemical and biological controls is sought and identified for a given insect pest.</p>

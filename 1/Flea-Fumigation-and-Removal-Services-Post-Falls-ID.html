<h3>Pest Treatment Post Falls ID 83854</h3>
<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical techniques such as cultural practices, use of resistant varieties, proper watering and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM considers the ecosystem as an entire and takes into account a well balanced mix of the previously mentioned control techniques to produce the most effective and least harmful strategy.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural enemies and discourage pest persistence consist of intercropping (several crops in the exact same field) to make it harder for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which bring in pests far from harvest crops and which can later be treated with choose application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to accompany times where pests have emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
<p>Pests controlled: Use horticultural oils to fight aphids, termites, beetles, leaf miners, caterpillars, thrips, leafhoppers, and whiteflies. Under EPM, chemicals must be utilized only as a last option, after mechanical, cultural, and biological methods have been attempted and revealed ineffective. Numerous pest control chemicals are poisonous and could be hazardous, if not used properly.</p>
<p>Other consistent and emerging pest issues consist of vectored animal and human diseases such as West Nile virus, Eastern equine encephalitis and Lyme illness; plant pests and diseases such as emerald ash borer and soybean rust; and more than 170 poisonous water, terrestrial or parasitic weeds continue to challenge pest managers in the U.S. and somewhere else, and need efficient pest management procedures.</p>
